=========================================
Package: Kernel Delphi Components (KDC)
Current Version: 1.0 (XU*8*207)
Original Release Date: June 2002
Dept. of Veterans Affairs
VHA OI System Design & Development (SD&D)
=========================================

The KDC1_0DG.ZIP file contains a standalone copy of the latest version of the 
"Kernel Delphi Components Developer's Guide," which consists of the following
two files:

     * Help (.HLP)  file

     * Contents (.CNT) file


By default, the "Kernel Delphi Components Developer's Guide" is distributed 
with the Kernel Delphi Components in Kernel Patch XU*8*207. When installing 
the KDC, the "Kernel Delphi Components Developer's Guide" is automatically 
integrated with Delphi, which must already be installed on a Programmer 
Workstation.

The KDC1_0DG.ZIP file allows non-developers or developers without Borland's
Delphi software to install the "Kernel Delphi Components Developer's Guide" 
separate from the KDC. Users can use the "Kernel Delphi Components 
Developer's Guide" to learn more about development using the Kernel Delphi
Components.

Installation Notes:
------------------

 1. Create a separate directory for the "Kernel Delphi Components Developer's
    Guide" help files. In a normal installation of the KDC the Help files are
    located in the following directory:

         c:\Program Files\VISTA\Kernel\Help


    It is important that the KDC.HLP and KDC.CNT files be located in the same
    directory. For example, the directory structure should look similar to the
    following:


                                  VISTA
                                    |
                                    |
                                  Kernel
                                    |                                        
                                    |        
                                  Help
                                    |
                              ______|______
                             |             |
                             |             |
                          KDC.HLP       KDC.CNT


 2. Download the KDC1_0DG.ZIP file into the directory you created/selected in
    Step #1.


 3. Unzip the file. Follow the normal procedures when unzipping a file.

 4. Open the "Kernel Delphi Components Developer's Guide" by double clicking
    on the KDC.HLP file. You can now browse the "Kernel Delphi Components 
    Developer's Guide" and learn more about development using VistA's Kernel
    Delphi Components software.
