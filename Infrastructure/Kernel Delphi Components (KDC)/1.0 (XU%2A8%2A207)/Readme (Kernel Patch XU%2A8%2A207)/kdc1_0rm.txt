Kernel Delphi Components (KDC) V. 1.0 Readme: Patch XU*8.0*207 initial release
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


General Comments:
----------------

Patch XU*8.0*207 provides the following new Kernel Delphi Components:


  * XUAlert          -- This is a non-visual component that provides an 
                        object and a wide range of capabilities with respect to
                        alert processing. It provides a mechanism by which an alert
                        can be set up to run either by a GUI application or via
                        Roll-and-Scroll.

  * XUAlertSurrogate -- This is a non-visual component that provides an AlertSurrogate
                        object and abilities to set or clear it for a user.

  * XUAlertButton    -- This button provides the ability to view and, as far as 
                        possible, to process alerts. Users who hold the XQAL DELETE
                        security key (e.g., ADPACs) have additional capabilities
                        (e.g., forwarding alerts, deleting alerts for other users,
                        and creation of alerts).  

  * XUDateTimeSelect -- This component provides a component for obtaining a date and 
                        time, which can be entered in a number of different ways 
                        (or, if the AllowDateRange property is set, a beginning
                        date and ending date).

  * XUMonthCalendar  -- This component provides a calendar for display.

  * XU_NameRules     -- This component should be placed on an application form as the
                        first component; all subsequent components will then be renamed
                        with a prefix according to the pending GUI SAC guidelines.

  * XUViewPropButton -- At run-time, this button can be used to explore the components
                        associated with the application's forms and the current values
                        of properties for those components.

please refer to the Help file that is included with this version (i.e., KDC.HLP).



Installation Notes:
------------------

Follow the installation instructions as written in the Installation Guide (i.e., KDC1_0IG.DOC).

The installation executable file for the Kernel Delphi Components (i.e., KDC1_0PG.EXE) will
automatically set up a directory structure similar to the following:


                                 VISTA

This installation also automatically installs the Kernel Delphi Components (KDC) into Delphi
and integrates the KDC online help with Delphi's help. After dropping a component onto a form,
give it focus, and press the F1 key to open the Kernel Delphi Components' help file 
(i.e., BROKER.HLP).

In the following $(DELPHI) is used to represent the base Delphi directory for a specified
version (e.g., this might translate to C:\Program Files\Borland\Delphi4).

For Delphi V. 4 -- The .bpl files are placed in the $(DELPHI)\Bin directory
                -- The .dcp files are placed in the $(DELPHI)\Lib directory
                -- Lines are added to the $(DELPHI)\Help\Delphi.cfg file, if they are not 
                   already present to add the Broker Help into Delphi Help.

For Delphi V. 5 -- The .bpl files and .dcp files are placed in the $(DELPHI)\Projects\Bpl directory
                -- Lines are added to the $(DELPHI)\Help\Delphi.cnt file, if they are not already
                   present to add the Broker Help into Delphi Help.

In the registry the following changes are made:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Help
   adds   kdc.hlp    and its directory path as the value
   adds   kdc.cnt    and its directory path as the value
